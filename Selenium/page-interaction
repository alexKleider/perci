3.1. Interacting with the page:

To interact with the pages, or, more specifically, the HTML
elements within a page. First of all, we need to find one.
WebDriver offers a number of ways to find elements. For example,
given an element defined as:

<input type="text" name="passwd" id="passwd-id" />

you could find it using any of:

element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "passwd-id")
element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "passwd")
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@id='passwd-id']")
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "input#passwd-id")
