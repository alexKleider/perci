# File: progress

Here I keep a log of where I am in the book.

Sun 12 Jun 2022 07:58:42 PM PDT  returning after a long absence.
Needed to create a new virtualenv called 'perci'
(python 3.6 not available- used python9.2)
edit ~/.bashrc: export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
Installed gecodriver:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.17.0 ==> Download
tar -vxzf gdV17.tar.gz && rm gdV17.tar.gz
mv gdV17 ~/.local/bin
Installed django & selenium:
python -m pip install "django<1.12" "selenium<4":
ft.py fails so decided to begin fresh from start!!!
Kept getting failures- incompatable selenium??

Reinstalled latest version of geckodriver
Running Selenium 4.2.0  (see requirements1.txt)
Reading from:
https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html
Got testscript.py and test_testscript.py to run smoothly.
Moved them into Selenium subdirectory with the html code...
Using wget, moved the "readthedocs" to the Selenium directory:
file:///home/alex/Git/Perci/Selenium/index.html
