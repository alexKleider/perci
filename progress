# File: progress

Here I keep a log of where I am in the book.

Sun 12 Jun 2022 07:58:42 PM PDT  returning after a long absence.
Needed to create a new virtualenv called 'perci'
(python 3.6 not available- used python9.2)
edit ~/.bashrc: export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
Installed gecodriver:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.17.0 ==> Download
tar -vxzf gdV17.tar.gz && rm gdV17.tar.gz
mv gdV17 ~/.local/bin
Installed django & selenium:
python -m pip install "django<1.12" "selenium<4":
ft.py fails so decided to begin fresh from start!!!
Kept getting failures- incompatable selenium??

Mon 13 Jun 2022 06:43:21 PM PDT
Reinstalled latest version of geckodriver
Running Selenium 4.2.0  (see requirements1.txt)
Reading from:
https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html
Got testscript.py and test_testscript.py to run smoothly.
Moved them into Selenium subdirectory with the html code...
Using wget, moved the "readthedocs" to the Selenium directory:
file:///home/alex/Git/Perci/Selenium/index.html

Tue 14 Jun 2022 05:59:14 PM PDT
Set up github repos for files in Perci dir exclusive of the "sl"
directory which has its own github PerciCode repo.
Working now in the 'sl' directory:
Stashed ft.py => future-ft.py and created ft.py as on page 15.
Got expected failure as 2/3 down p16.

Wed 15 Jun 2022 12:52:32 PM PDT
Did a commit of both this dir (git@github.com:alexKleider/perci.git)
and the sl directory (git@github.com:alexKleider/percicode.git)
after getting to end of page 19.
=> manage.py startapp la  # short version of "lists"
Begin unittesting using django.test.TestCase under 'ls' directory.
Failing SmokeTest => failure      ==> a commit
Review p 25ff Django's MVC, URLs, & View Functions
(Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern <except>
    models
    views are more like controllers
    templates are the view part
Purpose: to resolve a URL.
Work Flow:
1. HTTP Request for a particular URL
2. Resolving the URL: decide which view function
3. View function processes request and returns an HTTP Response.
Test:
1. can we resolve '/' to a particular view function?
2. does this view function return test passing HTML
To pass we need a URL mapping: urls.py
Got to end of p 30 and did commit
Got to end of p 35 and did commit

Thu 16 Jun 2022 03:51:07 PM PDT
got to end of p42 and did a tagged commit
Create ls/templates
Register (add) app to (listing) INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
Use ls/templates/home.html (strip() may be necessary)
Challenge of comparing rendered html with what view returns is solved
by django.template.loader.render_to_string
"Double-Loop" Test Driven Development p54 

Fri 17 Jun 2022 07:21:15 PM PDT
Using POST request (for now)
Dealing with Cross-Site Request Forgery exploit: {% csrf_token %}

Processing a POST request on server requires <form> to have an action
attribute:  <form action=...  Without it, submission goes back to same
URL (i.e., /)
Initially solve by fudging the views.py home_page

Use View code => Variables => Template
