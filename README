"""Test-Driven Development with Python""" by
Harry J.W. Percival  2nd Edition

for the sake of brevity I've used shorter versions of the names he
suggests:

Name              Book                      My Repo
====              ====                      =======
Project name:     superlists                sl
Functional test   functional_tests.py       ft.py
App name          lists                     la      #for list app

Rarely used but important to know commands:
$ django-admin.py startproject <projectname> .  # dot or a directory.
$ ./manage.py runserver
$ ./manage.py startapp <appname>
$ ./manage.py test


Django Work Flow
================
1. Receive a request: a URL
2. Resolve the URL to a view function
3. Pass the request to the view function which
        returns an HTTP 'response'.

Testing
=======
1st test was badmath to verify tests are being run.
2nd test that '/' resolves to home_page (a function)
    must set up views.home_page to make it pass
3rd test for an html response
